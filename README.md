# TIC TAC TOE

My first project with Python: a classic, simple game of 'Tic tac toe' with an AI opponent

### Discription

Tic tac toe is a two-player game. In this case, it is based on the player-vs-computer format. Each player has a symbol (typically X and O), and the first one to get one continuous line of tiles (be it horizontal, vertical or diagonal) filled with his/her symbols is the winner.

The game takes place on a 3x3 grid starting with all tiles being empty. The players take turn placing tiles of their respective symbols. The game is completed if there is no empty tile left or if one of the two player successfully forms **a continuous line of three tiles** with his/her symbols.

### Instruction

In order to play the game, run the file tic-tac-toe.py in either an IDLE for Python 3.x or a Python 3.x interpreter.

Ex: PyCharm...

First, you will be presented with the title screen on which there will be three buttons for you to choose:
  "Easy": means you are going to play with a basic AI that only chooses its moves randomly
  "Norm": means you are going to play with an AI whose moves is calculated to fit a normal person's
  "Hard": means you are going to play with an educated AI that use Minimax algorithm which you are **NOT** likely to be able to defeat
  
 After choosing the level of difficulty, you will be led to a 3x3 grid as mentioned above.
 
**Remember: You're always 'X' and 'X' makes the first move.**

Click any tiles that you want to place your symbol in and the game starts.

If you wish to play again, click the renew button on the bottom-left corner of the window; if you wish to experience other levels of difficulty, click the menu button to be back to the title screen.

### To-do in the future
